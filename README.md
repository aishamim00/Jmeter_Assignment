# JMeter Performance Testing
## Project Overview
This project contains JMeter performance test collections for two scenarios:
### Load Test & Throughput Analysis
- Limited the test duration to a maximum of 20 minutes.
- Verified whether the server can handle the expected load.
## Performance Testing for Booking API
In the scenario Total user: 120000 and Time Period: 12 hours = 12 * 60 * 60 seconds = 43,200 seconds
Throughput (Requests per Second): 120,000 users / 43,200 seconds â‰ˆ 2.78 requests/second
##### Conducted tests in 3 steps:
- 5-minute load test
- 10-minute load test
- 20-minute load test

## Stress Report Analysis
After pass the load test we conduct the stress testing starting from 20 minuntes and inceasing the user to find the capacity point and bottleneck.

### Conducted tests until find the bottleneck:
- 20-minute load test for 7500 users
- 20-minute load test for 9000 users
- 20-minute load test for 12000 users
